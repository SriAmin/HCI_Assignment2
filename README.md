# HCI_Assignment2
This is a prototype for COVID Alert, an application that allows users to see statistics and resources about COVID-19, but most of all, will be a platform for seniors to reqest and acquire assitantce from helpers which are also users of the application. 

The 5 new desirable features of the application are:
1. Allow the elderly to acquire help related to their in person problems which can as vast as it can be
2. A feature that can catagorize reqest in certain catagories and allow helpers to filter and assist issues that they please
3. Present statistics of COVID-19 in relation to a map, allowing users to see the cases in a more visually pleasing and location based method
4. Aim to focus on Canada and Ontario more spehically rather then including several other provinces and locations
5. Group information about COVID-19, including the guides/tips/advice, to organize and help the user easily find information that they desire

The prototype screenshots are listed below along with a public Figma link and link for a video demonstration.
